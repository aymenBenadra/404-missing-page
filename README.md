<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)

This is a basic project made with Html and SCSS for learning purposes, as I used concepts and techniques such as Flexbox and many other things. And I also learned how to transform a figma design to Html and CSS code by trial and error.

I encorage everyone who wants to escap the Toturial Hell to try it out, it's so fun! and will help you know your limits sooner, and help you fix it the right way (not by watching more toturials :3).
